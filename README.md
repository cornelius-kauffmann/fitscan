## Run locally
Any static server works, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` → http://localhost:8000. Camera scanning requires HTTPS or localhost.

## Deploy
Hosted on GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`). All paths are relative, so it works under `/fitscan/`.
